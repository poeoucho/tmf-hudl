Logo at logomakr.com/7IdjJ0 - saved here as tmf-custom-rom.png
Created my free logo at LogoMakr.com

The file downloaded from logomaker is 8-bit RGBA.  Remove the alpha channel with
convert infile.png -alpha off outfile.png

Run mkanimation in this directory to overlay the logo onto the second
stage boot animation and create a new bootanimation.zip file that
can be used to replace the (/system)/media/bootanimation.zip
file in system.img

TODO - we should have an option to skip the (very slow) compression so that
we can have a fast turn around during development
