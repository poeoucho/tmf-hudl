All development was done on a Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) box. Some (or all?) of these
tools are may be available for other platforms.  If you are building then Ensure
that the build tools are available on your path.

There are other tools available for flashing - see 04-INSTALL for more infomration.


(1) Tools to build the image:
-----------------------------

(a) imgrepackerrk - for packing and unpacking RockChip image files
  Download and unpack the lastest executable from https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2257331

  On 64-bit Ubuntu I needed to enable 32-bit apps with:
  >$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
  >$ sudo apt-get install libc6-i386

(b) Tools for generating the bootanimation (see bootanimation/mkanimation:
  zip, unzip, composite, zopflipng

  >$ sudo apt-get install zip unzip imagemagick zopfli

(c) (rkflashtool &) rkmisc
  rkmisc is ued by the build process to generate a misc partition that forces
  a wipe of the /data and /cache partitions on first boot after install

  >$ sudo apt-get install rkflashtool

(d) syslinux
  Used when building the bootable flash disk image
  
  >$ sudo apt-get install syslinux

(2) Tools to flash the image:
-----------------------------

(a) adb
  Optional, but install includes the udev rules to allow access to the USB
  devices without needing root permissions so this is recomended.  If present
  it may be used by the tmf-flash.sh script to put the Hudl into bootloader
  (flashing) mode.

  >$ sudo apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools

  After installing add the following to /lib/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules if
  there is not an entry for these venodrs/products, this will allow use of both

  #Archos (Tesco Hudl - needed to allow adb to work without root permission)
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0e79", ENV{adb_user}="yes"
  #Rockchip RK3188(Hudl in bootloader/flash mode - needed to allow rkflashtool to work without root permission)
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2207", ATTR{idProduct}=="310b", ENV{adb_user}="yes"

(b) rkflashtool
  used by tmf-flash.sh to actually flash the image to the device.  Can do 'partial'
  flashes e.g. only the system partition which is a good speed increase during
  development. Can also read teh flash back to your computer, useful for backup.

  >$ sudo apt-get install rkflashtool


(2) Other tools
---------------

(a) apktool
  useful for instpecting/modifying the contents of .apk files
  Follow the instructions at https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/
