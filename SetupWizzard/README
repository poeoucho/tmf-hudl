In the stock builds the setup wizzard does not complete due to an expired certificate on 
the Tesco server at https://device.mobile.tesco.com/

Ideally we'd modify the setup wizzard (part of the Settings.apk application) but
unfortunately apktool won't re-build even an unmodified version of Settings.apk that
it unpacks.  If anyone knows how to get apktool to play nicely then I'd like to change how
the setup wizard is disabled, so please let me know.

As we can't diretly disable the setup wizard by disabling it in the application's manifest
we use the pm (package manager) tool to do this for us - but we need to issue the pm commands
as root and only once the Android VM is up and running and able to accept commands.  To
achive this we hijack the /etc/install-recovery.sh script that runs during boot and we set
off the pm command running every 10 seconds until it is either successful or until we have been
trying for about 5 minutes.

The component that needs disabling is
com.android.setting/.wizard.WizardRoot

and the pm command is

pm disable com.android.setting/.wizard.WizardRoot
