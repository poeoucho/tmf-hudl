Known Issues/Thigs still to be done
====================================================================================

- Remaining branding
   - Really the launcher needs replacement as it still contains a few
     customisations - especially the helping 'guidance' screens (child advice,
     tesco button, how to add icons to the homepage, etc).  But these all only
     appear once and are simple to dismiss.  The stock launcher is not actually
     too bad.

- Updates to remaining stock apps
   - It would be good to provide updates to the stock apps, but when I try to do
     this as part of the image I end up with an unstable system (and a
     non-functioning Google Play Services).  Currently the stock version of the
     play store and play services get updated, and then the rest of the apps can
     be updated

- Update or Remove Google+/Currents App
   - The stock version (Google+) no longer works and the upgrade (Google Currents)
     doesn't run on such an old Android version.  Either remove the app, or update
     it to a version of Google Currents that does work (e.g. the version from the
     Helios ROM)

- Recover space from the system partition.  The System partition is only just over
  50% full.  It should be possible to recover most of that space and change the
  parameter map to give a bit more space to userdata.  BUt may not be worth the effort
