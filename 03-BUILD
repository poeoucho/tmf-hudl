The build process is fairly straightforward.  Clone this repository, and then
from the repo root directory run

  >$ sudo ./build.sh

Root permission is required to have enough priviledges to remove and correctly
create files within the Android image. In short it does the following:

1. Downloads the stock image (if not already downloaded), and unpacks it
2. Make modifications
3. Re-packs the modified image

The build script itself is well documented with the changes it makes.  Should
you wish to apply additional changes they either add them to the build script,
or get the build script to leave the build artefacts and then manually make
modifications before running the build script again to re-pack.  Run

  >$ ./build.sh -h for information on available options.
