The build process is fairly straightforward.  Clone this repository, and then from the repo
root directory run
>$ sudo ./build

Root permission is required to have enough priviledges to remove and correctly
create file within the Android image. IN short it does the following:

1. Downloads the stock image (if not already downloaded), and unpacks it
2. Make modifications
3. Re-packs the modified image

The build script itself is well documented with the changes it makes.  Should
you wish to apply additional changes they either add them to the build script,
or comment out the final 'rm' in the build script and manually apply your
changes to the files in the .dump directory before manually repacking the image.
